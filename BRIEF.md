## Design Requirements
Build a modern, mobile-first pizza restaurant website. Warm, inviting, professional. Dark theme is fine but must be readable and visually rich (NOT the nearly-blank current site).

### Pages / Sections (single-page with nav anchors + separate menu page):
1. **Hero** - Restaurant name, tagline "Passion for Pizza | Original Syracuse Style", Order Online CTA button, phone number
2. **About** - Ross family story, est. 1957, 3rd generation, 9 locations. Fix the typo from their current site ("establisted" → "established", "snd" → "and"). Personalize for Fayetteville location.
3. **Menu** - Full web-native menu (NOT a PDF). Organized by category with prices. Categories: Appetizers, Salads, Burgers, Sandwiches, Chicken Sandwiches, Philly Subs, Pizza (sizes + toppings + specialty). Include the 5% cash discount note and 10% discount on $150+.
4. **Photo Gallery** - Grid layout, placeholder images for now (use warm pizza/restaurant stock placeholders or colored divs)
5. **Location & Hours** - Address, phone, hours, embedded Google Maps iframe, "Visit our Camillus location" cross-link
6. **Contact** - Simple contact form (name, email, message), phone number, social links
7. **Footer** - Social links (Facebook, Instagram), copyright 2026, cross-link to Camillus location

### Key Features:
